🧠 About Coyot AI

Coyot AI is an experiential learning platform on a mission to make Artificial Intelligence accessible, practical, and inspiring for students across schools and colleges. We help students not just learn AI—but experience its real-world power through hands-on projects, live demos, and domain-specific applications.

Founded by industry veterans and AI engineers from Fortune 4 companies, Coyot AI bridges the gap between classroom theory and industry reality. Our programs are carefully crafted to help students build job-ready portfolios, understand cutting-edge tools like GPT, Claude, and Gemini, and prepare for top roles in the AI ecosystem.

🌍 What We Do

🔹 AI Workshops for Schools (Grade 3 to 12):
We conduct captivating AI and tech workshops for school students—combining storytelling, interactive demos, and ethical tech conversations. Students explore how AI powers apps, games, art, medicine, and more—without needing coding knowledge.

🔹 GenAI & LLM Workshops for Colleges (B.Tech, BCA, MCA & CS/IT Departments):
We offer one-day, high-impact workshops that take students from zero to project-ready. They learn prompt engineering, deploy LLM-based apps, and build live projects like AI chatbots and autonomous agents—guided by real-world AI professionals.

🔹 Domain-Specific AI Experiences:
From medicine to law, media to finance—Coyot AI offers tailored sessions that demonstrate how AI transforms every field. Students from non-technical backgrounds also get to explore how to work alongside AI in their own careers.

🔹 Portfolio-First Approach:
Every workshop is built around tangible outcomes—students build real projects, host them on GitHub, and showcase them in resumes and portfolios that stand out to recruiters and internship providers.

🔹 No-Code AI Innovation:
We empower students to innovate using no-code and low-code AI tools, helping them become AI creators—not just consumers—regardless of their programming background.

🌟 Our Belief

We believe that AI is not just for coders. It’s for dreamers, doctors, designers, engineers, and every curious mind. Coyot AI exists to spark that curiosity, ignite confidence, and make students future-ready in an AI-powered world.
