About Coyot AI

Coyot AI is an experiential learning platform founded in January 2025 by a passionate team of engineers and educators — Mohammed Favas, Sainudheen, and Shyamila — with a bold mission: to make Artificial Intelligence accessible, hands-on, and inspiring for every student, from classrooms to campuses.

We go beyond just teaching AI. At Coyot AI, students experience its real-world power through interactive workshops, live demos, and industry-grade projects. Whether it’s building your own chatbot, understanding how ChatGPT works, or exploring how AI can transform medicine, law, or media — we make future tech tangible.

Founded by industry professionals from Fortune 4 companies, Coyot AI bridges the critical gap between academic learning and industry skills. We equip students with the tools, thinking, and portfolio to thrive in an AI-driven world.

🌍 What We Do

🔹 AI Workshops for Schools (Grade 3 to 12)
We conduct engaging and age-appropriate workshops for school students, filled with stories, interactive AI demos, and creativity. Students explore how AI powers daily life — from chatbots and games to health apps and art — all without needing coding skills.

🔹 GenAI & LLM Workshops for Colleges (B.Tech, BCA, MCA & CS/IT Streams)
For college students, we deliver powerful, one-day hands-on sessions on GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Students master prompt engineering, build AI apps, and create real-world projects using cutting-edge tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Hugging Face, and LangChain — all guided by engineers working in the field.

🔹 Domain-Specific AI Experiences
AI isn’t just for coders. We offer tailored workshops for students from fields like medicine, law, finance, psychology, media, and more — helping them understand how AI integrates into their career paths and how they can work with it, not be replaced by it.

🔹 Portfolio-First Learning
Every session is built around outcomes. Students walk away with deployable AI projects, GitHub portfolios, and content they can proudly feature in resumes or internship applications. We believe projects speak louder than certificates.

🔹 No-Code AI Innovation
Whether or not you know programming, we help you build with AI. Using no-code and low-code tools, students can innovate and solve real problems with AI — making creativity the only prerequisite.
